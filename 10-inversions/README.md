# Inversion

## Description

Write a program that count the number of inversions of an array.


## Input

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases.
Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines.
The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10000) denoting the size of the
array. The next line contains the array values (1 <= v <= 30000).

### Sample Input

```
2

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
4
8 4 2 1
```


## Output

For each case, output the number of inversions of each case.
