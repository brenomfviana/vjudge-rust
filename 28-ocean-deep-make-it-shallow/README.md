# Ocean Deep! - Make it shallow!!

## Description

Ocean deep
  I'm so afraid to show my feelings,
  I have sailed a million ceilings
  In my solitary room
Ocean deep

The lines above are from a very popular song of Cliff Richard. In this problem
we will be dealing with a similar type of person. His name is
Rampell-Stilt-Skin and another important thing is that he is a dead man.
Someone has killed him a few days ago and you are the detective to solve the
mystery. The problem with this guy is that he always tried to hide his
information and feelings under the sea (I mean out of reach). He wrote a diary,
which contained some statements and then a large binary number (May have as
many as 10000 digits). If the number is divisible by a large prime number
131071then the statement is true, otherwise the statement is false. In this
problem you will be given large binary numbers as input and you will have to
verify if that number is divisible by 131071 or not. Your algorithm needs to be
very efficient.


## Input

The input file contains several binary numbers. Each binary number starts in a
new line but may expand in several lines. Each number is terminated by a '#'
symbol. No line contains more than 100digits.

### Sample Input

```
0#
1010101#
```


## Output

For every binary number print 'YES' if the number is divisible by the given
prime number, print 'NO' if the binary number is not divisible by the given
prime number.

### Sample Output

```
YES
NO
```
