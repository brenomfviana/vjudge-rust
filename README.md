# VJudge Rust

## Description

This repository contains Rust solutions of some VJudge problems. These problems
were homeworks for the Algorithms Project course of University of SÃ£o Paulo
(USP).

When I code these solutions there was no option for send Rust code to VJudge or
another code judging system. I also did not find any Rust solution for these
problems. I solved the course homeworks by using C++, however I wanted to become
better in Rust. Therefore, I decided to recode these homeworks by using Rust to
learn the Rust way to solve problems. Besides, the codes could be more cleaner
but I decided to avoid using the `unwrap()` function to try the Rust
suggestions of coding. As I was learning during the course, then the probably
first solutions need some refactoring to do to make the code more cleaner or
there are better Rust ways to solve these problems.
