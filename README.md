# VJudge Rust

## Description

This repository contains Rust solutions of some CodeChef and UVa problems.
These problems were homeworks for the Algorithms Project course of University
of SÃ£o Paulo (USP).

When I code these solutions there was no option to send Rust code to VJudge
(the official code judge of our class) or another code judging system
(**Are we judged yet?**). I also did not find any Rust solution for these
problems. I solved the course homeworks by using C++, however I wanted to
improve my Rust skills and develop Rust solutions could be not trivial (and
were not) for some problems. Therefore, I decided to recode these homeworks by
using Rust to learn the Rust way to solve problems. I have made a lot of code
refactoring as you can see on the commits list. My first implementations did
not have a clean code and there were a lot of improvements to make. I just did
these improvements after the end of my course and I maybe do improve a little
more sometime later.


### Some observations

- Rust code, in some situations, can be very verbose due the use of `Option`, `Result` and `HashMap`;
- Rust code can be very clean, we can do a lot of things with little code;
- Reverse sort could be simpler (something like `rev_sort()`) not all of this: `sort_by_key(|&num| Reverse(num))`
- C++ HashMap is very different of Rust HashMap. The first one is really flexible, but can lead to unpredictable behaviors because an element can be created just by calling for a not added key (`hmap[i]`). Rust HashMap is more strict because the borrowing rules.


### Some things that I missed

- Tuple assignment for already defined variables, something like:
  ```
  let (mut a, mut b) = (0, 0);
  (a, b) = (4, 2);
  ```
  Maybe there is a reason for Rust do not allow this, but it would make the code cleaner.
- The `do...while` syntax sugar. I prefer use this:
  ```
  do {
    a += 1;
  } while a > b;
  ```
  Instead of this:
  ```
  loop {
    a += 1;
    if a > b { break }
  }
  ```
  Maybe we also could have a `do...while let`, but I cannot think in an example of usage of this.
- A function to read char by char from an input (`read_char(&mut char)`):
  ```
  let mut input = char::new();
  io::stdin().read_char(&mut input);
  ```
  Use this function is better to use for some problems, like the last one of this repository.
